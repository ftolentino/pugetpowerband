  600: '#c026d3', // And this one
  // etc.
}
\`\`\`

### Update Band Name
The band name comes from Sanity, but you can also update it in:
- \`components/Navigation.tsx\`
- \`app/layout.tsx\` (page title)

### Add New Sections
Create new components in the \`components/\` folder and add them to \`app/page.tsx\`.

## Troubleshooting

- Restart the development server after changing environment variables

### Images not loading

- Make sure images are published in Sanity Studio

### Studio not loading
